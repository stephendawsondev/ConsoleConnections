## User testing

I shared the app with friends and family and asked them to test it. I asked them to test both the test user and real user versions of the app. I also shared the app in the Code Institute #peer-code-review channel and with my Code Institute cohort. I asked them to report any bugs they came acorss and to give feedback and the user experience. I used the feedback to make changes to the app.

## Code testing

I used the [Code Institute PEP8 validator](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) to check my code for PEP8 compliance. I also used the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) to check my HTML for errors. I used the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to check my CSS for errors.
