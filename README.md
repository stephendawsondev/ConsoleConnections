|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------- |--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| "Running startup command: python3 run.py" command appearing when app starts.      | Run command to clear console before app starts.           |      Y       | Resolved using the solution here: https://www.delftstack.com/howto/python/python-clear-console/     |
| For age input, any text input was breaking the app.                               | Assert the type of the age variable.                      |      Y       | I was able to resolve the issue by returning the function if necessary components were not met.     |
| When pulling a list from Google Sheets, the data passed back was a string.        | Convert the string to a list using the json module        |      Y       | I was able to resolve the issue by converting the string to a list using the json module.           |
| Data that has single quotes and doesn't work with json.loads                      | Use a regex to replace single quotes                      |      Y       | Used regex to replace single quotes at start and end of words and not within words                  |
| The update genders method outputs each letter instead of each gender              | Use a regex to replace single quotes and use json.loads   |      Y       | Used regex to replace signle quotes with double quotes for valid json string                        |
| "IndexError: list index out of range" when sorting list by nested list value      | Change the reference to the list length                   |      Y       | Changed `key=lambda x: x[2]` to `key=lambda x: x[1]`                                                |
| Got a few circular import errors when trying to break down my classes             | Restructure so that classes don't import each other       |      Y       | When I had to call a function from another class, I instead passed a callback function to the class.|
| After completing or redoing the compatibility quiz, the answers aren't the user's | It could be that the value is being overwritten           |      Y       | When presenting the quiz options screen, I was using the existing instance's data instead           |
