# Console Connections - CI PP3

[Click here to use the live Console Connections App](https://console-connections-5cf111ff9c73.herokuapp.com)

Console Connections is a terminal-based dating app. By setting your age and gender preferences, and answering a few compatibility questions, you can find a match (or matches). Once both of you have allowed for contact, you can send messages to each other. The app runs in the Code Institute Mock Terminal, which is deployed on Heroku.

## Using the app - Login/Registration steps

### Establishing user type
When the user runs the app, they are presented with the option to choose whether they are a test user or a real user. The reason for this is that the app is connected to a Google Sheet, and the test sheet is full of dummy data (and other test user data), so it's best to use the test user option to avoid messing up the real user data.

### Signing up
After selecting whether or not the user is a test user or real user. The user will be given the opportunity to log in or sign up for an account. When they choose to sign up, a six-digit usercode is generated for them. If they complete the signup process, that will be their usercode for logging in in the future. During the signup process, the user is asked to create a password, add two security questions (for password/usercode recovery) and to create an alias any in-app communication. Once they have provided that information, the user's information is added to the Google Sheet. They are also logged in and taken to the main menu.

### Logging in
When the user chooses to log in, they are asked to provide their usercode. Since the Google Sheet type is already selected, the usercode is checked against the Google Sheet. If the usercode is found, the user is asked to provide their password. If the password is correct, the user is logged in and taken to the main menu. If the password is incorrect, the user is asked to try again.

## Using the app - After logging in

### Main menu
Once logged in, the user is presented with the main menu. From here, they can choose to view their compatibility quiz answers or take the quiz, edit some of their profile details, view their matches, view their messages, message their matches or log out.

### Compatibility quiz
The compatibility quiz is a series of ten questions. The user is presented with a question that has two to four options. They can choose one of the options by typing the number of the option. Once they have answered all ten questions, their answers are saved to the Google Sheet. If they choose to retake the quiz, they are taken back to the start of the quiz. If they choose not to retake the quiz, they are taken back to the main menu.

### Edit profile
On the edit profile page, the user is presented with the information they can't change and the information that they can change. The user can update their password, their security questions, their bio, the genders they want to match with and the age range they want to match with. If they make a change to their profile, it won't be saved until they click the "Save and exit" option. Once they save, the data is updated in the Google Sheet and they are taken back to the main menu.

### View matches
On the view matches page, the user is presented with a list of their matches. A potential match will only be considered when:
1. The potential match's age is within the age range that the user wants to match with.
2. The user's age is within the age range that the potential match wants to match with.
3. The potential match's gender is one of the genders that the user wants to match with.
4. The user's gender is one of the genders that the potential match wants to match with.

Once other users are filtered by gender and age preferences, the answers of the compatibility tests are compared. A user must have a compatibiltiy score of 60% or more in order to display a match. The list is sorted by the matches with the highest compatibility. From there, the user can choose to view the match's profile. If both users have allowed for contact, the user can also choose to message the match.

### View messages
On the view messages page, the user is presented with a list the last messages sent by their matches. The list is sorted by the most recent message received from a match. The user can choose to view the messages from a match. From there, they can choose to send a message to the match.

### Log out
When the user chooses to log out, they are logged out and taken back to the login/signup page.

## Planning

### User stories

As a first-time user, I want:
- to be able to sign up for an account
- to be able to edit my profile
- to be able to take a compatibility quiz
- to be able to view my matches
- to log out of my account

As a returning user, I want:
- to be able to log in to my account
- to be able to edit my profile
- to be able to view my messages
- to be able to message my matches

As a frequent user, I want:
- to be able to edit my profile
- to be able to view my message history
- to see new matches as they become available

### Flowcharts

### Google sheet headings

I used Google Sheets to store user's data, compatibility quiz answers and messages. There were some iterations of the headings used in the sheet:

#### Initial Google Sheet headings:

usercode,	password, alias,	security_question_1,	security_answer_1, security_question_2,	security_answer_2,	bio,	gender,	genders_seeking,	age,	age_range_seeking,	messages_sent,	messages_received,	allow_contact_list,	question_1,	question_2,	question_3,	question_4,	question_5,	question_6,	question_7,	question_8,	question_9,	question_10	

#### Second iteration of Google Sheet headings:

usercode,	password,	alias,	security_questions,	age,	gender,	bio,	genders_seeking,	age_range_seeking,	messages_sent,	messages_received,	allow_contact_list,	compatibility_answers

#### Final iteration of Google Sheet headings:
 usercode, password, alias, security_questions, age, gender, bio, genders_seeking, age_range_seeking, messages, allow_contact_list, compatibity_answers, row_num													

### Messages structure

The structure of messages was a little tricky as it required some nested lists. I decided to store the messages in the Google Sheet as a string. I used the json module to convert the string to a list. I used the following message structure in user's message section:
```
[
  [usercode, last_message_received_timestamp, 
    [
      [message, user_sent(true/false), timestamp],
      [message, user_sent(true/false), timestamp]
    ]
  
  ],
  [another_usercode, last_message_received_timestamp, 
    [
      [message, user_sent(true/false), timestamp],
      [message, user_sent(true/false), timestamp]
    ]
  ],
  [another_usercode, last_message_received_timestamp, 
    [
      [message, user_sent(true/false), timestamp],
      [message, user_sent(true/false), timestamp]
    ]
  ]
]
```

## Testing

I used the Code Institute Mock Terminal to test the app. I asked family and friends to test both the test user and real user versions of the app. I also tested the app myself. I used the following test cases:
